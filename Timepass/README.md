-Features 💥

1. Theme toggling ☀️🌙 - so it consists of theme toggling which gets save in your local storage, the default theme is dark BTW btu can also change    the theme into whie if you want and the theme will unchange even after leaving this page 

2. Slides - I have also included slides in this project which shows multiple content at single place.
the slides moves automatically and also it stops moving when the user hovers his/her mouse at specific slide, this prevents misclick to another link 
the slide also consists of nav buttons which can be used to go to the next and previous slide.
